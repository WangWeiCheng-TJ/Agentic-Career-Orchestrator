# Input: The Conflict
We have "Expert Voices" (Requirements from Phase 3) vs. "Candidate's Ammo" (Existing Resume).

## 🗣️ Expert Voices (The Demands)
{% for opinion in council_opinions %}
- **{{ opinion.role_name }} ({{ opinion.expert_id }})** demands: {{ opinion.must_haves | join(", ") }}
{% else %}
(No specific expert opinions provided.)
{% endfor %}

# Task: Strategic Synthesis & Ghostwriting
Your job is to resolve gaps and create a **Comprehensive Execution Plan**.
**DO NOT LIMIT the number of bullet points.** Generate as many as necessary to cover ALL expert demands and showcase the candidate's strongest relevant achievements.

## ⚖️ Conflict Resolution Rules (The "Brain")
1. **Tech vs HR:** For this technical role, prioritize **Technical Depth** (Expert E2/E6) over generic HR fluff.
2. **Safety vs Risk:** If a Security Expert warns about risks, that takes precedence over "Growth Hacking".
3. **Fact vs Fiction:** Do not invent projects. If the Candidate's Ammo lacks a specific skill, create a "Transferable Skill" bullet.
4. **Consistency:** Ensure the final voice is consistent. It should sound like ONE senior engineer, not a committee.

## 📝 Execution Rules (The "Hands")
Iterate through the Expert Demands and the Resume to construct the final list:

1.  **Strategy A: The "Must-Haves" (Priority)**
    * For every skill demanded by the Experts:
    * If you find a match in the Resume -> **REUSE** (Verbatim) or **TWEAK** (Inject keywords).
    * If you find a gap -> **NEW** (Draft a defensive bullet using transferable skills) or **COVER_LETTER** (If it's a narrative fit).

2.  **Strategy B: The "Power Moves" (Bonus)**
    * Identify strongest achievements in the Resume that are relevant to the role but not explicitly asked for.
    * Include them as **REUSE** items to demonstrate extra value.

**🚫 CRITICAL NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS:**
- **NO "SKILL PACKS"**: Do not output short phrases.
- **NO META-TALK**: Do not describe what to write. **WRITE IT.**
- **FULL SENTENCES ONLY**: Every output must be a complete, copy-paste ready bullet point.
