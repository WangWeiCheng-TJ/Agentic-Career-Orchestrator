**About the job**

Applied Research Engineer - Generative Al for 3D Avatars

**The Opportunity**

A leading tech giant is building the core technologies behind the next generation of realistic digital humans. Sitting at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and 3D representation, this team is focused on turning cutting-edge research into systems that scale into real products.

On their behalf, we're looking for a recently graduated or Phd candidate to join as a Applied Research Engineer with a strong grounding in generative models and visual computing to help advance how expressive, efficient, and lifelike 3D avatars are created and represented.

**What You'll Be Working On**

*   Developing and refining generative models that encode and reconstruct human appearance, motion, and expression in 3D
*   Exploring new approaches across image and video generation, facial expression modeling, and full-body or clothing representation
*   Translating research ideas into working prototypes and production-ready components
*   Running controlled experiments to evaluate realism, robustness, and computational efficiency
*   Partnering closely with researchers and engineers to move ideas from paper to platform
*   Keeping a sharp eye on emerging research and integrating what genuinely works

**What We're Looking For**

*   Master's degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Applied Mathematics, or a closely related field (PhD highly advantageous)
*   Early industry or research experience (typically 1-2+ years) in areas such as:
    *   Generative models for images or video
    *   Human face, expression, or body modeling
    *   Computer vision and machine learning
*   Strong coding ability in Python and/or C++
*   Hands-on experience with modern deep learning frameworks (e.g. PyTorch, TensorFlow)
*   A solid grasp of 3D concepts such as geometry, rendering, or spatial representations

**Nice to Have**

*   Doctoral research in a relevant domain
*   Experience training or deploying models at scale
*   Publications or open contributions to respected ML or CV venues
*   Exposure to avatar systems, 3D reconstruction, or digital human pipelines

**Why This Role**

This is a genuine applied research position-not theory for theory's sake. You'll have the freedom to experiment, the expectation to ship, and the chance to work on problems that will define how people interact in immersive digital worlds over the next decade.
