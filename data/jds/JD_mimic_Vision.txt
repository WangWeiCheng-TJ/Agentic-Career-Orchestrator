platform. Our automation solutions, driven by dexterous robotic hands and
cutting edge Al trained on human observations, bring a new level of Al
embodiment to the real world.

As an Al Research Engineer (Robot Learning) you will drive frontier Al model
development and data flywheel project management for dexterous robotic
manipulation. You will shape all aspects of the development of end-to-end Al
models for robotics, from large scale multi-task pre-training to specialized fine-
tuning and post-training. You will also be responsible for the implementation
and management of the data flywheel process, supervising and organizing task
specification, data collection, model training and model evaluation in the real
world. As an early employee, you will immediately co-lead Al engineering and
science in close contact with the founders and early team.

**Responsibilities**

*   Drive research and implementation for large scale, multi-task foundation
    Al models for robotics, quickly iterate over architecture design and
    parameters
*   Oversee model specialization for end use cases with fine-tuning and
    other post-training techniques
*   Drive the implementation and management of the data flywheel process,
    from data specification, to data collection, model training and real world
    evals
*   Write clean, maintainable python code using deep learning frameworks
*   Work closely with the Robotics and Hardware teams to ensure efficient
    and stable deployment on real world robots

**Requirements**

*   Fluent English speaker

**Nice to have**

*   Published deep learning and/or robot learning research in leading
    conferences (NeurIPS, CORL, ICML, ICLR, etc.)
*   Experience in training large scale foundation models with distributed
    multi-GPU setups
*   Robotics and ROS2 experience
*   Experience with RL fine-tuning of generative models
*   Experience in open source software development

**Compensation & Benefits**

*   We offer a total compensation package including a competitive yearly
    base salary and a strong stock option package to make you part of our
    shared success.
*   You will work with the founders from day one, shaping the company and
    participating in its success from its early stages.
